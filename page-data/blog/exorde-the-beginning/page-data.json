But if they were local at the time, they can now travel around the world in seconds thanks to social networks and impact a very large audience. Indeed, 4.48 billion people are active on social networks every month and 56.8% of the world's population is part of a social network (Statista, July 2021).</p>\n<p>With such a large number of users comes a gigantic production of information. <a href=\"https://www.domo.com/learn/infographic/data-never-sleeps-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Every minute, 240,000 photos are shared on Facebook and 500,000 tweets are posted</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/pexels-pixabay-267389.jpg\" alt=\"social networks phone\" title=\"Social networks on phone\"></p>\n<p>In this flood of information, it is difficult to sort out, and misinformation can then make its way easily. It is estimated that <a href=\"https://252f2edd-1c8b-49f5-9bb2-cb57bb47e4ba.filesusr.com/ugd/f4d9b9_b7cedc0553604720b7137f8663366ee5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">only 12 people are responsible for 65% of the false information on covid in the US</a>.</p>\n<p>This misinformation directly threatens our societies by leading to climate inaction, by playing a dominant role in elections and by preventing people from vaccinating themselves on the basis of false arguments. They also create a bipolarisation of society between 'pro' and 'anti' camps based on two completely different realities depending on what they read on their social media feeds.</p>\n<h1>Decentralisation as a solution</h1>\n<p>With Exorde, we want to add nuance to this flood of information. By tracing the spread of information on the web and linking similar facts together, we will allow you to browse your news feed with a trust score associated with each piece of information. You will also be able to find in one click all the sources and media dealing with information similar to what you are reading.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/pexels-faik-akmd-1025469.jpg\" alt=\"cluster,data,desert,sunset,science\" title=\"Data cluster in front on sunset\"></p>\n<p>To achieve this, we are creating a decentralised economy and community whose mission will be to cross-check all the information on the web and to note the sources behind each piece of information. These contributors will be rewarded with the crypto-currency we create and will be able to progress through our system over time. We will discuss the major role of our crypto-currency token in more detail in the next article.</p>\n<h1>Team</h1>\n<p><img src=\"/img/capture-d%E2%80%99e%CC%81cran-2021-11-02-a%CC%80-12.07.07.png\" alt=\"Exorde Team - Terence Gras, Mathias Dail, Damien Pucheu\" title=\"Exorde Team\"></p>\n<p>We are three co-founders: Térence, Mathias and Damien.
